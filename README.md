# Sleep Edit

Sleep is often overlooked even though its one of the most important aspects of living. It may seem as though your body "turns off" during sleep, but in reality sleep is when your body processes many different functions.

Sleep takes responsibility for making new connections in your brain, resting your body, and reinforcing things you already know.

Sleep Edit is an app created to help you control your sleep, and to maximize the benefits you gain with a proper sleep plan. With its simple user interface, you can easily edit your night for an optimal sleep plan.
